# GKS Think Tank

GKS Think Tank is a monthly virtual hackathon held on the **last Wednesday of every month**,
from **2 PM - 3:50 PM EST**. To be alerted about upcoming Think Tanks, subscribe to the [Genomic Knowledge Standards Work Stream](https://www.ga4gh.org/work_stream/genomic-knowledge-standards/) or watch for announcements on social media (e.g., [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/ga4gh.org), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ga4gh/posts/?feedView=all) or [X](https://x.com/GA4GH)).

This is an **informal** space to:

* Explore new ideas
* Collaborate on ideas with the GA4GH community
* Learn more about GKS

Since this is a new working session, we'd love feedback on how we can improve. You can
either create a new issue (to discuss in a GKS Think Tank meeting) or discussion.

## Format

Main communication is in the public GA4GH #gks-think-tank Slack channel.

### 2 Weeks Before the GKS Think Tank meeting

We will call for any project proposals to be submitted for consideration two weeks prior
to the next GKS Think Tank meeting.

We try to aim for around 2-4 breakout rooms each meeting.

#### Submitting a Project Proposals

To propose a new project, please submit your idea using our
[GitHub issue template](https://github.com/ga4gh/gks-portal/issues/new?template=think-tank-proposal.yaml).

If you would like to re-use an existing issue from a prior hackathon, please add the
GKS Think Tank label and update the issue to include the
[`Required Maintainer(s) Attendance` section](https://github.com/ga4gh/gks-portal/blob/update-organization-and-gks-think-tank/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/think-tank-proposal.yaml).

#### Expressing interest
Check out the repository [proposal tracker](https://github.com/ga4gh/gks-portal/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22GKS%20Think%20Tank%22). 
and express your interest in proposed hackathon projects with
[reactions](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/)
on the top-level comment. If you want to see a proposed project clarified or otherwise
revised, add a comment to the issue and get a discussion going! Your engagement is essential because the Genomic Knowledge Standards Work Stream heavily relies upon [community feedback to direct development efforts](https://vrs.ga4gh.org/en/stable/appendices/maturity_model.html).

### The Week of the GKS Think Tank meeting

We will announce the projects that are selected the week of the next GKS Think Tank
meeting. Typically, these are projects that generate the most interest and engagement.

Project lead(s) should add what they would like to be accomplished in their respective
GitHub project proposal issue.
