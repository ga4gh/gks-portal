this commitment but still wish to participate, please email <lbabb@broadinstitute.org>
and <kori.kuzma@nationwidechildrens.org>.

**Registration is just $20!** With only 30 spots available, registration will be on a
first-come, first-served basis. Please register [here](INSERT_LINK) ASAP to secure your
spot. Only registered participants will be eligible to participate.

## Project Proposals

To propose a project, please submit your idea using our
[GitHub issue template](https://github.com/ga4gh/gks-portal/issues/new?template=project-proposal.yaml).
We encourage you to submit your proposal ASAP so others have a time to review your
proposal before the event.

Check out the repository [proposal tracker](https://github.com/ga4gh/gks-portal/issues)
and express your interest in proposed hackathon projects with
[reactions](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/)
on the top-level comment. If you want to see a proposed project clarified or otherwise
revised, add a comment to the issue and get a discussion going!

## Proposal Selection

Each proposal will have 1-2 minutes at the start of the hackathon to give a brief pitch.
After the pitches, we will break off into smaller groups to focus on the proposals that
generate the most interest and engagement.
