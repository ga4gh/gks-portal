# GA4GH GKS Connect 2025 Hackathon

The GA4GH Genomic Knowledge Standards (GKS) Work Stream will be hosting a hackathon
immediately prior to Connect on **Sunday, 30 March from 12:00 to 17:00 EDT and Monday,
31 March from 8:00 to 17:00 EDT**. We invite software developers and data modelers
committed to making ongoing contributions to GKS to participate in this highly
interactive and collaborative technical session. To support the event, a $20
participation fee will be collected upon registration.

## Registration

**Registration is just $20!** With only 30 spots available, registration will be on a
first-come, first-served basis. Please register
[here](https://broadinstitute.swoogo.com/ga4gh-connect-GKS-hackathon-2025) ASAP to
secure your spot. Only registered participants will be eligible to participate.
We are requiring participants to attend both days for the full duration. If you cannot
meet this commitment but still wish to participate, you will be added to a waitlist.

## Project Proposals

To propose a project, please submit your idea using our
[GitHub issue template](https://github.com/ga4gh/gks-portal/issues/new?template=project-proposal.yaml).
We encourage you to submit your proposal ASAP so others have a time to review your
proposal before the event.

Check out the repository [proposal tracker](https://github.com/ga4gh/gks-portal/issues)
and express your interest in proposed hackathon projects with
[reactions](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/)
on the top-level comment. If you want to see a proposed project clarified or otherwise
revised, add a comment to the issue and get a discussion going!

## Proposal Selection

Each proposal will have 1-2 minutes at the start of the hackathon to give a brief pitch.
After the pitches, we will break off into smaller groups to focus on the proposals that
generate the most interest and engagement.
