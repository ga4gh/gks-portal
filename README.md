# GKS Portal

This repository contains information on upcoming Global Alliance for Genomics and Health
(GA4GH) Genomic Knowledge Standards (GKS) hackathons.

## GKS Think Tank

GKS Think Tank is a monthly virtual hackathon held on the **last Wednesday of every month**,
from **2 PM - 3:50 PM EST**.

This is an **informal** space to:

* Explore new ideas
* Collaborate on ideas with the GA4GH community
* Learn more about GKS

Since this is a new working session, we'd love feedback on how we can improve. You can
either create a new issue or discussion.

### Project Proposals

To propose a new project, please submit your idea using our
[GitHub issue template](https://github.com/ga4gh/gks-portal/issues/new?template=think-tank-proposal.yaml).

If you would like to re-use an existing issue from a prior hackathon, please add the
GKS Think Tank label and update the issue to include the
`Required Maintainer(s) Attendance` section.

Check out the repository [proposal tracker](https://github.com/ga4gh/gks-portal/issues)
and express your interest in proposed hackathon projects with
[reactions](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/)
on the top-level comment. If you want to see a proposed project clarified or otherwise
revised, add a comment to the issue and get a discussion going!

### Proposal Selection

Each proposal will have 1-2 minutes at the start of the hackathon to give a brief pitch.
After the pitches, we will break off into 2-4 break out rooms to focus on the proposals
that generate the most interest and engagement.
