# GKS Portal

This repository contains information on upcoming Global Alliance for Genomics and Health
(GA4GH) Genomic Knowledge Standards (GKS) hackathons.

## Hackathons

### GKS Think Tank

GKS Think Tank is a monthly virtual hackathon held on the **last Wednesday of every month**,
from **2 PM - 3:50 PM EST**.

This is an **informal** space to:

* Explore new ideas
* Collaborate on ideas with the GA4GH community
* Learn more about GKS

For more information, see the [GKS Think Tank README](./hackathons/gks-think-tank.md).

Since this is a new working session, we'd love feedback on how we can improve. You can
either create a new issue or discussion.
